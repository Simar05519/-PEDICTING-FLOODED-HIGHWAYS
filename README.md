# -PEDICTING-FLOODED-HIGHWAYS
The dataset has the date, area, code, warning, and type of flood. The date column shows the date and time of the warning issued from the flood warning system. This study offers an integrated methodology for identifying the most vulnerable places to flooding along a roadway in order to prevent such effects and propose adaptive actions for current infrastructure. The dataset contains various flood warnings. On the basis of flood warnings, we will analyze the flooded highways from the dataset with the help of machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Naïve Bayes. After exploratory data analysis, data cleaning is also one of the important steps to perform further analysis.  Every organization must make data accurate and up-to-date. Data cleaning removes the enormous data which is not good for the analysis. If our data is not perfect then it does not provide accurate data and our algorithms will provide unreliable output. We clean and preprocess the data using Label Encoding techniques. Some of the machine learning algorithms are also performed here such as Bagging Classifier, Decision Tree, Extra Tree Classifier, Random Forest, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, and KNN Model. Bagging Classifier provides a more accurate result as compared to other machine learning techniques. Data Visualization is also performed here to explore the data and identify the results.
